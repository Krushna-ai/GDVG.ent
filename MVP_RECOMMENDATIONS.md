# MVP Recommendations for GDVG

This document outlines a clear, actionable roadmap for developing the Global Drama Verse Guide (GDVG) into a cohesive and functional Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

## Executive Summary

The backend of GDVG is exceptionally feature-rich, while the frontend is currently underdeveloped. The most effective path to a successful MVP is to **focus development efforts on building out the frontend** to create a user interface for the backend's core functionalities.

By prioritizing the essential user journey, we can launch a polished and valuable product sooner, while deferring more complex features to post-launch updates.

## 1. Defining the MVP Scope

To ensure a focused and timely launch, the MVP should be centered around the following core features.

### Core MVP Features (To Be Implemented)

-   **[✔] User Authentication:**
    -   User registration and login.
    -   Clear, persistent authentication state across the application.
    -   A functional logout process.

-   **[✔] Content Discovery:**
    -   A homepage to browse trending or new content.
    -   A search feature to find specific content.
    -   A detailed view for each piece of content, showing its synopsis, cast, and other metadata.

-   **[✔] Watchlist Management:**
    -   The ability for users to add content to a personal watchlist.
    -   Functionality to view the watchlist.
    -   The ability to update the status of an item (e.g., from "Want to Watch" to "Completed").
    -   The ability to remove items from the watchlist.

-   **[✔] User Profile Management:**
    -   A dedicated page to view a user's profile information.
    -   The ability for users to edit their own profile (e.g., name, bio, avatar).

### Advanced Features (To Be Deferred Post-MVP)

The backend already supports many advanced features. To streamline the MVP launch, we recommend **deferring the frontend implementation** of the following:

-   **[✖] Advanced Social Features:**
    -   Liking and commenting on reviews.
    -   Following other users.
    -   Social activity feeds and notifications.
    *(Reason: These features add significant complexity. A strong content and watchlist experience is a better foundation to build upon.)*

-   **[✖] Personal Analytics:**
    -   The detailed user analytics dashboard.
    *(Reason: This is a "nice-to-have" feature that can be added later to enhance user engagement.)*

-   **[✖] AI-Powered Recommendations:**
    -   The "For You" personalized recommendations.
    *(Reason: The "Trending" and "New Releases" sections are sufficient for content discovery in an MVP.)*

-   **[✖] Monetization:**
    -   Premium subscription plans.
    -   Ad integration.
    *(Reason: It is best to focus on user growth and product-market fit before introducing monetization.)*

## 2. High-Level MVP Roadmap

The following is a high-level roadmap of the development work required to complete the MVP. The focus is almost entirely on the frontend.

### Frontend Development Tasks

1.  **Refactor Application Structure & Routing:**
    -   **Goal:** Move from a single-page layout to a multi-page structure.
    -   **Action:** Implement `react-router-dom` to create distinct routes for the homepage (`/`), login (`/login`), register (`/register`), user dashboard (`/dashboard`), user profile (`/profile/:username`), and content details (`/content/:id`).

2.  **Build Out Authentication Flow:**
    -   **Goal:** Create a seamless and secure authentication experience.
    -   **Action:** Replace the current modal-based auth with dedicated pages for login and registration. Implement a global authentication context or state management solution to handle user state throughout the app.

3.  **Implement the User Dashboard:**
    -   **Goal:** Create a central hub for authenticated users.
    -   **Action:** Develop the `UserDashboard.js` component. It should provide a summary of the user's watchlist and links to their profile and settings.

4.  **Implement Watchlist Management:**
    -   **Goal:** Allow users to manage their watchlists.
    -   **Action:** Build out the `WatchlistManager.js` component. Connect it to the backend API to fetch, add, update, and delete watchlist items.

5.  **Build the User Profile Page:**
    -   **Goal:** Allow users to view and manage their public profile.
    -   **Action:** Develop the `UserProfile.js` component. Fetch and display user data. Implement an "Edit Profile" feature for the logged-in user.

### Backend Development Tasks

-   **Status:** The backend is largely **MVP-complete**.
-   **Action:** No major development is needed. The work will be limited to:
    -   Potentially minor bug fixes or adjustments that arise during frontend integration.
    -   Ensuring all necessary API endpoints for the MVP features are stable and documented.

By following this roadmap, we can efficiently build a polished and functional MVP that provides immediate value to users.
